My name is EinsKatze, also known as Pascal, and last year I finished an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for system integration.

Im into linux & privacy and self-hosting stuff, but overall i really like all kinds of tech.

As you may have already noticed from the favicon or my [profiles](../contact) such as discord or github, i really like cats.

Keep an eye out for future updates to this page.

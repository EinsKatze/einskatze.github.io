My name is EinsKatze, also known as Pascal, and a few months ago I finished an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for system integration.

Im into linux and privacy, but overall i really like all kinds of tech.

As you may have already noticed from my other [profiles](../contact) such as discord or github, i really like cats.

Keep an eye out for future updates to this page.

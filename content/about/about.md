Hey there, im EinsKatze aka. Pascal. \
Currently I am doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for system integration.

Im interested in Linux, Internet Privacy and Coding. \
As you may have already noticed from my other profiles such as discord or github, i really like cats.

I may add a little more to this page soon™️, but as of now, i don't now what else you would like to know about me.
